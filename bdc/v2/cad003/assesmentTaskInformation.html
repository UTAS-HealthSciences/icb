<h3>
	Instructions for critical friends </h3>

<p>
	As a critical friend, your main aim is to help your peer get the best result possible but for this activity it does not mean looking at grammar or spelling. </p>

<p>
	What you will be doing is reading their essay and asking yourself throughout - does this make sense to me? what would I do to make it clearer? how can I explain my ideas to my peer in a supportive manner? </p>

<p>
	If it does not make sense, you need to think of a clear way to articulate why it does not make sense to you. </p>
<ul>
	<li>This may be because what is expressed is unclear. Often when we write something, we have something in our head and it does not quite make it to the essay. This may mean that important information is missing.
	</li>
	<li>It may be because the writer has made assumptions about what the audience knows. You need to remember that the final audience is made-up of university lecturers, not workers in aged care, so is what is said clear for people who do not have expertise in your area?
	</li>
	<li>From what you know of paragraphing and topic sentences, does it seem to you as if this essay flows? If it does no - make constructive suggestions: 'I would...' 'It may work well if...' 'Consider...'. It is not your place to tell your peer how to do something, but to use your knowledge to suggest things which you feel would strengthen their work.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As well as this, you need to ask yourself if you know of anything that could enhance the essay. Have you read a resource, been to a training session or undertaken something in your workplace which could help to support the essay? </p>

<p>
	Remember that the more feedback you can give, the more your peer has to work with and the easier it will be for them to reflect on your comments. Also remember that it can be difficult to allow anyone to read your work but this is a tool which you are going to use throughout your studies to help you to gain greater insight into your own writing and that of others. </p>

<h2>
	<strong>Example essay</strong>
</h2>

<p>
	After years working in the community care setting, I have recognised my personal strength as one of being a team player. According to Pigott (1976 p.32), a team player is part of a, ‘group of people working together towards a common goal’, in this case client satisfaction and care. The community care group comprises of management, care staff, clients, their carers, their families and other collaborative stakeholders, who all contribute differing skills towards that goal. Walsh (2006 p.231), points out that, ‘Happy and valued staff usually means happy clients’. Part of my strength as a team player is supporting and empowering the care workers to be the best that they can. Indeed as Walsh (2006 p.232), states, ‘the resulting increased self esteem will have positive returns for client care’. </p>

<p>
	Currently, I am employed as a case manager, but have worked from the ground up as a care worker. In a letter of application to undertake the associate degree in dementia care on 15 August 2012 I stated, ‘I believe that my experience as a care worker gives me an empathy with the clients and their carers that I can use in my case management role today’. I provide client’s family members with information as identified. I also monitor carer stress and encourage carers to look after themselves first. If support is needed, I have the contacts to enable this fairly promptly. Having been a care worker myself also gives me an understanding of ‘burn out’ in care workers, as Walsh (2006 p.231), states, ‘there are greater financial rewards to be had working in the local supermarket’. It becomes important to continually engage care workers with regular support and supervision sessions. At our team meetings we have the opportunity for a guest speaker; this is usually at the request of care staff. A popular speaker recently was a representative from the the ___ as we have a client living with this illness. </p>

<p>
	As a case manager, I wear many hats; advocating for clients and their carers, supporting and educating care staff, payroll, rostering, budget management, staff training, work health and safety representative and attending network and interagency forums. As well as this workload I take my share of after hours on call and also fill in for other offices when their staff take leave. In December, I shared anecdotes from colleagues in my E-portfolio to evidence my willingness and flexibility. </p>

<p>
	Evidenced by the most recent client satisfaction survey in my workplace (Benevolent Society 2011), no one person can do it alone. One client states, ‘without the help of the Benevolent Society I would not be able to live in my home’. The human interaction of staff and the community connectedness with clients has resulted in a very positive response. The teamwork ethos that is fostered in my work place has impacted greatly on beneficial outcomes in client care. As Johnson (cited in Pigott 1976, p.32) stated, ‘what makes us human is the way in which we interact with other people’. Another benefit of this team interaction is noted by (Borrill et al. 2000) in stating, ‘those working in teams have much lower levels of stress than those working alone’. The social, emotional and practical support of working in a team can be a great solace in times of difficulty. I also offer care workers the employee assistance program whenever I debrief with them. </p>

<p>
	The area where I am based has recently become the focus of government attention for additional funding dollars, due to its projected growth and the identified need. In the last six weeks I have been part of a team that have put in at least 16 funding applications. Over the next three months we should find out whether we have been successful. </p>

<p>
	Of course the organisation within which a team operates can influence team effectiveness. My organisation fosters cooperation which leads to a more positive work attitude. Demarcation boundaries are broken down as (Borrill et al. 2000) states, ‘team members share goals and are mutually accountable for meeting them’. </p>

<p>
	The values of my organisation are the key to the team’s success: Integrity, Collaboration, Optimism, Respect and Effectiveness. We have been exploring what these values mean to us and how we can display these values in our day to day work and interactions. </p>

<p>
	I continually evaluate my progress and that of my care workers to identify needs in the area of professional learning. Continual improvement of self leads to greater job satisfaction and increased self esteem. I have recently undertaken and passed a TAFE course in cultural awareness as I live in a multicultural area. A client’s cultural background can influence the way dementia is displayed and managed. This needs to be taken into consideration when formulating the care plan. I have also assisted care workers with their studies in Certificate 3 and Certificate 4 in aged care. This team work approach to learning has empowered one care worker to leave and become a paramedic. Now I am undertaking the associate degree in dementia care, I hope to be able to influence standards of care for the aged and use the knowledge gained in training future care workers. In the future I would like to undertake the Certificate 4 in front line management as I am interested in the psychology behind fostering skills for a collaborative goal. </p>

<h2>
	Example </h2>

<p>
	Initially I was confronted by the idea of showing anyone else my work. I feel that I worried over this more than the idea of submitting it to Helen, which is strange because she, not my colleague is the person who is really judging my work; my colleagues are, like me grappling with the task. It was a comment from Fred (pers. comm., see Appendix 2), where he explained that he learnt about his writing by reading mine, that made me really look at this task in a different way. This was not about being judged by my colleagues, nor even Helen, this was about learning more about the learning process and getting better by sharing information with what Helen refers to as our ‘community of scholars’ (H Ceperkovic 2013, pers. comm., 12 July). </p>

<p>
	I was delighted with the many helpful pieces of advice I received about my reflective journal from my two critical friends: Chris (pers. comm, see Appendix 1) and Fred (pers. comm., see Appendix 2). Likewise, I know that I tried very hard to write useful, helpful and supportive feedback in turn them both, though I am yet unsure if I was sufficiently critical. I agree that critical reflection provides a way of “standing back and seeing my issues from a different viewpoint” (Fook &amp; Gardner 2007, p. 10). This then encourages an appreciation of what can be gained through taking multiple perspectives on board (Cottrell 2013, p. 245). I was alerted to the fact that some of my evidence may be off track or a little too old (pers. comm., see Appendix 1) and, on reflection and reading the pages in Cottrell (2013, pp 192-3) I could see the point and altered my work accordingly. What was interesting was that this reading of Cottrell then led me to edit my work in other ways which I would not have considered if I had not been alerted to the evidence by Chris ((pers. comm., see Appendix 1). </p>

<p>
	Overall, I agree with Chris’ comment (pers. comm., see Appendix 1) that ‘ what is important is not [her] comments but rather the nature of the process’ and the ability to look at my own work with a new perspective. This was a new experience for me, as I wrote few academic essays in my past life as a student. I am sure that the feedback I have received has helped me structure my writing more professionally and I received a wake-up call about improving my in-text referencing this week too! I believe this task has brought together several important threads of this unit of study: academic writing, reflection, referencing, formatting, and collegial sharing, and I feel much more confident now about submitting my writing for assessment by colleagues in the future. </p>
