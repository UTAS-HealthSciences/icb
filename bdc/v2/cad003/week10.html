					<em>Critical thinking when writing includes most of the elements of critical thinking you would use when reading. It can be more difficult to analyse your own work critically, however, and to recognise and admit to your own opinions and bias.</em>

				<h1 class="page-header">Module 5</h1>

				<p>In the previous week (week 9) there was a
					<strong>Collaborate session entirely devoted to essay writing</strong>. I encourage you to view the session as it will be the basis for the lecture and tutorial for week 10. Before attending the second Collaborate session on
					<strong>Wednesday 14 April, 4 PM,</strong> it is vital that you
					<strong>download the PDF</strong> from the link in the "to do this week" section below. Indeed, if you are unable to attend then you will need to have a copy of the PDF while watching the subsequent recording of the session. During the unit you have completed a number of activities and assignments designed for skill development for the final assignment. I hope that you view this week's materials as it is a way to help you "fine-tune" your writing skills.

				<h2>REFERENCING</h2>

				<p>This is the link to the university's referencing guide. You need to select the Harvard tab. For those of you in CAD001 there is a video about this in week 5 materials.</p>

								<p>For this week you are expected to
									<strong>view the recording of the Collaborate session (part 1) from week 9, 30 April, 2014.</strong>This is an excerpt from the PDF which will be the basis of the Collaborate session.
								</p>

								<p>All assignments at university are designed to challenge you to write in different forms. The purpose of them is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate several things:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Your knowledge and understanding of a topic;</li>
									<li>Your ability to research a specific aspect of the topic set in the assignment; and</li>
									<li>Your ability to organise supporting information and evidence within a structured piece of academic writing</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>What is an essay?</strong></p>

								<p>An essay is a specific argument which has a theme, logically expressed from start to finish. It tests your knowledge and understanding of a topic, supported by research. An essay is also an exercise to develop and handle relevant ideas, construct a clearly expressed argument and refer to the arguments made by academics. An essay is a powerful learning tool that will help to develop your understanding of a subject.</p>
