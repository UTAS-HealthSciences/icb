					Some students are caught out because they think that, at the right moment a tutor will remind them of what they should know or do, especially if this is what happened at school or college. Although that may happen occasionally, it is not typical. It is usually up to you to make sure that you are up to speed with what you need to know

					This module </h1>

				<p>
					This module we are continuing working on really getting comfortable with using MyLO and on your emerging skills with paragraph writing. The reading for this week is the remainder of the first chapter of Cottrell (2013) and deals with aspects such as managing life as a student, managing anxieties and resources, the student experience, and resources available to you. It is important to complete the activities presented in this chapter. The feedback I have received from students about this text has been overwhelmingly positive and in fact a number stated that this text answered a number of questions they had regarding university study. By week three you will be expected to have your own copy of the Cottrell text (details of this are in the unit outline) and if you had ordered it in week one it should be arriving to you in time. </p>

				<p>
					This week I will be focusing on linking words, avoiding repetition, an introduction to discursive essays, and some more linking words and phrases. </p>

								<p>Your reading for week 2 is the
									<strong>first chapter from page 24 to page 34</strong> from your prescribed text. If you do not have it yet, then the chapter is in the reading list. You can find the reading list on the right-hand side of the first page of CAD003. Look for the text by
									<strong>Cottrell</strong>.</p>

								<p>
									As you undertake the reading, pay special attention to the points about getting to know people on page 24. As an online student with face-to-face sessions, you have the ability to actually meet some of your peers, but your peer group is much wider than this. </p>

								<p>
									Do the activity on page 29 and keep this is your personal journal. Bear in mind that the university/college materials will have an online focus. </p>

								<p>
									Complete the checklist on pp 30-31. </p>

								As a result of what you have read in the reading this week (Cottrell pp 24-34), begin to make another network of peers online. Use the discussion board to find other people with whom you are able to network. You might want to find other people who do your job, or other people who are able to spend time online at a particular time, other people who do something different from you - to give you a broader perspective, etc. What is important is that you make an effort to create
								<strong style="word-spacing: normal; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.4;">circles of study buddies</strong> who are able to support you in your learning and who you are committed to supporting too.
