			<h2>VISUAL INFORMATION</h2>

			<p>This week will be focussing on how to interpret and use visual information in your writing. The lecture for this week is based on the material from Bailey (2013, pp. 158-65), chapter 2.11 (Visual Information), which is available from the CAD003 reading list, and some of the activities are completed by the lecturer and others are discussed to help you understand how to do these yourself. </p>

			<h2>ESSAY WRITING - COLLABORATE SESSION REMINDER</h2>

			<p>Before attending the second Collaborate session on Wednesday 14 April, 4 PM, it is vital that you download the PDF from the link in the "to do this week" section below. Indeed, if you are unable to attend then you will need to have a copy of the PDF while watching the subsequent recording of the session. During the unit you have completed a number of activities and assignments designed for skill development for the final assignment. I hope that you view this week's materials as it is a way to help you "fine-tune" your writing skills.</p>

			<h2>REFERENCING</h2>

			<p>This is the link to the university's referencing guide. You need to select the Harvard tab. For those of you in CAD001 there is a video about this in week 5 materials.</p>

							<p>This week's lecture is about supporting your discussion using information presented in a visual form. You will be expected to be able to describe and interpret information presented in various visual forms. Indeed, you may be required in other units to be able to produce your own visuals and it is important that you are able to do this in an appropriate and meaningful way. Academic writing requires the writer to not only present facts but to use such information to support the given discussion and to enhance the reader's understanding.</p>
