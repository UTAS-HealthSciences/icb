		<p>This module we are working on really getting comfortable with using MyLO and on your emerging skills with paragraph writing. If you need to, go slowly, read and re-read and write and re-write. It is important to remember that this unit is the first of many units in this course. Whilst the skills you will develop during this semester will serve you well in this unit it is important for you to remember that I see this as a continuing process for the duration of this degree. Some skills will "come" relatively quickly, others will take longer, but the important thing is to "pace" yourself. It is tempting, indeed admirable, to spend much more time in the first few weeks of a unit only to discover that sustaining such a workload is difficult. Conversely, it is all too easy to not engage with the material in the first few weeks and to suddenly realise that the workload has indeed increased and that your skill set has not reached the necessary level to complete tutorial tasks or indeed assignments. For this, and many other reasons, I strongly suggest that you read the Cottrell text (see below) for it gives valuable and important advice and more importantly the tools needed for a successful student at university level. The excerpt (chapter 1) should give you enough material to read until you purchase a copy of the text. This is the only text that needs to be purchased by you. The remainder of our texts are all digital and will require you to learn how to access and utilise them.</p>

		<p>For those of you studying CAD001, a unit that will indeed be extremely important for you in terms of accessing materials to ensure a successful level of engagement, you will notice a number of new and exciting tools and concepts presented to you. I will also cover some of the material presented in the first few weeks of CAD 001 however this is mainly for the benefit of those who are not enrolled in that unit and/or I consider to be valuable enough to show you in the context of this unit.You will notice that in module 2 (week 3) the amount of time you need to spend with the tutorial materials will increase.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to the degree by Andrea Carr</h2>

		<p>You need only watch this video once but you will find it in each of the foundation units.</p>

		<p>For each video you are given, you will have two options - a streaming and a download option. The streaming options allow you to view the video online, so you need to be connected to the Internet for the time that you view it. The download videos are able to be downloaded to your computer and watched when you are not connected to the internet.</p>

		<p>It is up to you which you select, but you will need to watch each of the videos selecting either download or stream options.</p>

		<h2>Unit outline</h2>

		<p>So, now that the unit has been introduced broadly, I would like to be a little more specific. If you have not already done so, please go through the&nbsp;unit outline video&nbsp;(you may have watched this in the news item).</p>

		<p>In every unit in your degree, there will be a&nbsp;<em>unit outline</em>. In each case this document will follow the same format. You need to be familiar with this document as it gives you important information about the requirements of each unit.
		</p>

		<p>In your MyLO units, the<em>unit outline&nbsp;</em>is located in two places. You can find it on the unit's home screen on the right-hand side. It is also available on the first of the<em>content</em>pages under&nbsp;<em>unit overview.</em>
		</p>

		<p>This video is in&nbsp;each of the foundation units, so you may already have watched it. If you have, go on to looking at CAD003 unit outline.</p>

		<p><a href="https://mymediaservice.utas.edu.au:8443/ess/echo/presentation/d4fa22f2-e910-4340-b2c3-aa19c2ecfed0"

			   target="_blank">The unit outline - (download)</a></p>

		<p>Then take the time to look over the unit outline for CAD003, noting the assessment task due dates and other requirements for the unit.</p>

		<h2>Lectures</h2>

		<p>This unit will require you to view lectures, videos, and other multimedia presentations. Take note of the two links given. One link will be a video stream while the other link enables the video to be downloaded.</p>

		<h2>Layout, format &amp; MyLO overview</h2>

		<p>This is introduced in CAD001, if you have already done/are already doing CAD001 please disregard this section.</p>

		<p>Please be aware that these lessons are designed for someone who is both new to MyLO and to UTas - this means that some of you, depending on your computer skills levels, may be much faster than your peers. Remember that we are a community of scholars and at some time we will each rely on others for our learning.</p>

		<p>What will usually happen is that you will be directed to some content - a video or a reading. This will sometimes be done with links where you have to click and will be taken to the content. At other times, for the readings, you will be directed to your reading list. After you have viewed or read the content and taken notes, come back to this page and do the next task. This will often be a discussion.There will always be a list labelled 'to do this week'; use this as a guide to ensure that you have covered all the content for the unit.</p>

		<p>Web browsers- it is important for you to have more than one web browser on your computer (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome are all web browsers). Sometimes MyLO does not work well with a browser and the first trouble shooting activity should be to select a different browser. Always start with Google Chrome as MyLO tends to work well on this browser.</p>

		<p>To get a browser, go to the Internet using your usual browser and search for Internet browser download. Select one of the browsers and follow the instructions to download it to your computer.</p>

		<p>Information on the bars- mini and nav bars -The mini-bar&nbsp;is the blue bar across the top of your MyLO page. It is always visible. If you scroll down a page, it stays at the top. It allows you to navigate to all of your units and to your own MyLO areas such as your eportfolio, mail and your personal information. Spend some time looking at each of the items on this bar. If you get lost, going to the left of the bar and selecting home will always return you to your first MyLO page.The navbar&nbsp;is the grey bar it is the bar which is important for you to navigate within each unit. It is important to navigate to tutorial material using&nbsp;content&nbsp;and then navigating to&nbsp;learning space. This way, you will be able to systematically work through each tutorial.</p>

			   target="_blank">Download the video</a></p>

		<h3>Profile set-up</h3>

		<p>Profile set-up- On the far right of your mini-bar you will see your name with a drop-down menu. If you go to the first item on that menu - profile - you are able to add information about yourself. Please add an image.</p>

		<h3>The nav bar</h3>

		<p>The nav(igation) bar is the grey bar under the UTas emblem. Take some time to visit each of the areas - content, discussions, dropbox, quizzes, grades, groups and other tools - to see what is located there.</p>

		<p>Remember that you will be doing most of your navigation in MyLO by starting at&nbsp;content&nbsp;and then going to the&nbsp;learning space.</p>

						<p>Read through the checklist on page 21 - which of these are provided for you here at UTas? You may need to have a look at the student resources on the website or browse your MyLO to find some of these.</p>

						<p>Undertake the reflection task on page 22. This is for you, not to be handed-in. You will be coming back to this journal throughout the semester, so you may like to start a new notebook or Word document on eportfolio page - do what works for you.</p>

							<li>responding positively to your peer's post - if, for example you had not thought of their particular outlook</li>

			<div><span style="color: #cc0000;">Semester 1, 2014&nbsp;</span>this is the semester you started</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>To find webmail, go to the UTas&nbsp;<span>homepage:www.utas.edu.au</span>&nbsp;the webmail link is located on the right-hand side.
			</div>
			<div>Once you click on webmail, you will find a page that looks like this:</div>
			<div>
				<img class="img-responsive" title=""
					 src="/content/enforced/56906-AW_CAB_14S1_4648/Images/webmail2.jpg?_&amp;d2lSessionVal=q6JpxuBflwuM9TGBlKLAHfY51&amp;ou=56906&amp;_&amp;d2lSessionVal=n5151xBQsqCGLkqceeiHjSFRj&amp;ou=67708"
					 alt="">
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>You need to use your UTas&nbsp;username&nbsp;and&nbsp;password&nbsp;to access this.</div>
			<div>If you want to change your password- note that there is this option in the pumpkin-coloured box on the page. Click on that and follow the instructions. This will change your UTas password for your mail, the library and MyLO.&nbsp;<span>If you have a problem with this, please call IT services and they will be able to reset your password.</span>
			</div>
			<div>To change your signature. Go to your webmail and look for the&nbsp;options&nbsp;tab - it should be on a blue bar in the upper left corner of the window. Go to options and you will see a space for your&nbsp;signature. Type your signature using the above example. You then need to tick the little box below the signature&nbsp;and&nbsp;press save&nbsp;- right-hand side button.</div>
			<div>Now you can go back to your mail. When you begin to compose an e-mail, you should see your signature. If you do not, go through the steps again.</div>
			<div>
				<div>Note, lecturer and tutor e-mails usually look like this:name@utas.edu.au</div>
				<div>So my e-mail is:&nbsp;<span style="color: #cc0000;">Robert.Ceperkovic@utas.edu.au</span></div>
				<div>Student e-mails look like this:&nbsp;<span style="color: #cc0000;">username@postoffice.utas.edu.au</span>
