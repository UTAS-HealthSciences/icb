			<h2>ASSIGNMENT 2 FEEDBACK</h2>

			<p>Hopefully you have listened to my comments in Turnitin. I was very impressed with the general quality of responses. The amount of feedback I have provided in this second assignment is substantially longer than the first. In some cases individuals will have to listen to me speak for three minutes! Here are some general comments and observations that I have made regarding the second assignment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure that you use formal language whenever possible. Avoid the use of jargon and if you must please ensure that you fully explain the meaning of the term, abbreviation, acronym etc. take the time to proof read your work.</li>
				<li>If you're unsure about the meaning of a word use a dictionary, such as the Oxford English dictionary.</li>
				<li>If you can, print out your assignment and read from the page. It does make a difference.</li>
				<li>Think about transitions from one paragraph to the next. Is it clear to the reader what direction the discussion is headed. Don't forget the use of linkers both within sentences and paragraphs. Think back to the face-to-face sessions.</li>
				<li>Present your ideas clearly and convincingly.</li>
				<li>Don't forget to use the filename conventions given to you in this unit as well as CAD001.</li>
				<li>Get enough sleep!</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>REFERENCING</h2>

			<p>This is the link to the university's referencing guide. You need to select the Harvard tab. For those of you in CAD001 there is a video about this in week 5 materials.</p>
